                 Title3Sub="Smart, Intuitive, and Multi-Support (Web & Mobile) Project - 2019"
                 Title4="Introduction">
        <Br12 /><strong>Erlay</strong> is a platform I designed in <strong>2019</strong>, created to facilitate collaboration between <strong>lawyers</strong> and their <strong>clients</strong> by automating <strong>task management</strong> and <strong>legal document handling</strong>. This personal project explores the <strong>redesign of legal workflows</strong> through a comprehensive UX approach, from user research to the design of <strong>desktop</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong> interfaces.

        <Br12 />Lawyers spend up to <strong>30%</strong> of their time managing <strong>unstructured documents</strong>, which negatively impacts their productivity and client experience. This project aims to <strong>automate repetitive tasks</strong> and <strong>streamline legal exchanges</strong> with a clear and proactive interface.

        <Br12 />The goal is to create a <strong>seamless digital space</strong> between the lawyer and their client, making legal processes more <strong>clear, efficient, and traceable</strong> through <strong>semantic automation</strong> mechanisms and <strong>action-driven workflows</strong>.

        <Br12 />The platform includes:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- <strong>Case and task tracking</strong>: segmentation of case steps, action recommendations for the client, synchronization of to-do lists;
            <Br0 />- <strong>Automatic document organization</strong>: semantic analysis and metadata for classifying client-submitted files;
            <Br0 />- <strong>Interactive client/lawyer interfaces</strong>: front-office guides the client, back-office enables the lawyer to validate, archive, and supervise;
            <Br0 />- <strong>AI integration</strong>: LLMs assist in understanding content and generating relevant recommendations or alerts;
            <Br0 />- <strong>Analytical dashboard</strong>: for tracking progress, exchange status, and service quality.
        </Indent>

        <Br12 />The platform is available on both <strong>Web</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong>, with a <strong>modular architecture</strong> that allows future expansion into other legal services (real estate, notary services, contract management, etc.).

    <SectionText Title5="My Role">
        <Br12 />I led this project from start to finish as an <strong>independent UX designer</strong>.

        <Br12 />I oversaw all the following steps:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- <strong>User research</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Feasibility analysis</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Experience mapping</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Wireframe design</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>User testing</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Desktop and mobile mockups</strong>
        </Indent>

        <Br12 />I also managed the <strong>coordination of technical constraints</strong> and <strong>business requirements</strong> to anchor the solution within a realistic and actionable framework.
    </SectionText>

    <SectionText Title5="Key Learnings">
        <Br12 />This project allowed me to <strong>experience a complete UX process</strong>, moving through well-structured phases of <strong>divergence</strong> and <strong>convergence</strong>.

        <Br12 />I enhanced my ability to <strong>transform user insights into concrete solutions</strong>, and to <strong>prioritize needs</strong> based on their real value.

        <Br12 /><strong>Data analysis</strong> — both <strong>quantitative</strong> and <strong>qualitative</strong> — played a key role in my design choices, particularly in <strong>selecting the most relevant channels</strong> and <strong>interface formats</strong>.

    <SectionText Title5="Discover Phase – Understanding Users">
        <Br12 />During the <strong>UX Discover</strong> phase, I conducted <strong>qualitative research</strong> to better understand user expectations and obstacles when interacting with legal services.

        <Br12 />I carried out:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- <strong>Structured user interviews</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Context of use analysis</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Competitive channel benchmarking</strong>
        </Indent>

        <Br12 />In addition, I performed a <strong>feasibility study</strong> to assess if the proposed solutions were realistic from a <strong>technical</strong>, <strong>business</strong>, and <strong>user experience</strong> perspective.

        <Br12 />The data collected (e.g., <strong>93% use email</strong>, <strong>56% use SMS</strong>) allowed me to:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- <strong>Prioritize the channels</strong> to be integrated
            <Br0 />- <strong>Identify the major pain points</strong>: lack of follow-up, poor communication, and perceived costs

    <SectionText Title5="Experience Analysis and Persona Construction">
        <Br12 />This section presents the <strong>key findings from user experience analysis</strong> and <strong>customer journey mapping</strong>.

        <Br12 />Using tools such as:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- <strong>Empathy map</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Journey mapping</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Emotional curve</strong>
        </Indent>
        <Br12 />This allowed us to <strong>deeply understand the motivations, behaviors, and emotions</strong> of users throughout their interaction with the platform.

        <Br12 />These elements are crucial to <strong>identifying friction points</strong> and <strong>improving the features and services offered</strong>.

        <Br12 /><strong>My personal experience</strong> as a user of legal services gave me a deeper understanding of the real expectations and lived situations.

        <Br12 />These <strong>personas</strong> were built from <strong>real cases collected during user interviews</strong>.
        <Br12 />They reflect <strong>typical profiles</strong> observed in concrete legal situations.

    <SectionText Title5="Pain Point #1: Notification">
        <Br0 /><strong>Identified Problem</strong>
        <Br12 />Users express a <strong>loss of trust</strong> in legal services, primarily due to:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- <strong>Lack of case follow-up</strong>: 28%
            <Br0 />- <strong>Lack of responsiveness</strong>: 26%
        </Indent>

        <Br12 /><strong>Findings from Interviews</strong>
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- Users want to be <strong>automatically informed</strong> without needing to follow up themselves.
            <Br0 />- Preferred channels are:
            <Indent>
                <Br8 />• <strong>Email</strong> (93%)
                <Br0 />• <strong>SMS</strong> (56.1%)
            </Indent>
            <Br0 />These channels are considered <strong>reliable, clear, and traceable</strong>.

    <VisionerImage Image=Images[7]>
    </VisionerImage>

    <SectionText Title5="Pain Point #2: Document Management">
        <Br12 /><strong>Identified Problem</strong>
        <Br12 />Lawyers spend <strong>10 to 30%</strong> of their time on <strong>manual tasks related to client documents</strong>, including:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- <strong>Poorly named or incomplete files</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Unsorted or expired documents</strong>
            <Br0 />- <strong>Unguided processes</strong> for end users
        </Indent>

        <Br12 /><strong>Findings from Field Feedback</strong>
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- Users <strong>do not clearly know what is expected</strong>:
            <Indent>
                <Br8 />• <strong>Which documents</strong>
                <Br0 />• <strong>Which format</strong>
                <Br0 />• <strong>Which deadlines</strong>
            </Indent>

            <Br8 />- The <strong>lack of document structure</strong> leads to:
            <Indent>
                <Br8 />• Delays
                <Br0 />• Forgetfulness
                <Br0 />• Numerous manual follow-ups
            </Indent>
        </Indent>
    </SectionText>

    <VisionerImage Image=Images[8]>
        <Br0 />Automation significantly reduces repetitive tasks, especially in structured cases like divorce. Immigration and economic cases still present a heavy document management load, justifying the ongoing optimization of processes.
