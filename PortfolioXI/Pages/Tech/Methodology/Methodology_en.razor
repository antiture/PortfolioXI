    <SectionText Title3="A Transversal Vision" Title4="Designing in the Age of Complex Systems">

        <Br12 />We are living in a time of <strong>unprecedented technological transition</strong>.
        <Br12 />Artificial intelligence, automation, and distributed architectures are not only <strong>reshaping the world</strong>, but also redefining product thinking, organizational structures, and the human role within systems.

        <Br12 />In this context:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- understanding the business alone is no longer enough;
            <Br0 />- designing a good user experience is no longer enough;
            <Br0 />- even <strong>mastering models</strong> is no longer enough.
        </Indent>

        <Br12 />I believe that <strong>true creativity</strong> and <strong>transformative capacity</strong> emerge from navigating across <strong>four core dimensions</strong> in parallel:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 /><strong>Business – Design – Models – Code</strong>
        </Indent>

        <Br12 />This is not a call for superficial versatility, but a commitment to an <strong>architectural mindset</strong>:
        <Indent>
            a way to <strong>unify</strong> analysis, design, execution, and evolution through <strong>systemic thinking</strong>.
        </Indent>

        <Br12 />This portfolio is not just a collection of “completed tasks”;
        <Br8 />it demonstrates a <strong>methodology</strong>, a <strong>systems perspective</strong>, and a <strong>capacity to craft meaningful architectures</strong>.

        <Br12 />Each diagram, model, and workflow aims to answer a central question:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 /><strong>How can we create human-centered coherence in increasingly complex technical systems?</strong>
            <Br8 />More fundamentally — <strong>How can we leverage these technical systems to construct human-centered models, such that each act of expression becomes an intervention in—and a rewriting of—the world itself.</strong>
        </Indent>

        <Br12 />If design was once a bridge between humans and screens,
        <Br0 />today it must also become a bridge between:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- humans and algorithms,
            <Br0 />- humans and systems,
            <Br0 />- humans and the future.
        </Indent>

    <SectionText Title5="Strategic Axes">
        <Br12 />The role of a Product Owner or Architect is to balance tensions between:
        <Indent>
            <Br8 />- <strong>market and technology</strong>,
            <Br0 />- <strong>possibility and constraint</strong>,
            <Br0 />- <strong>vision and implementation</strong>.
